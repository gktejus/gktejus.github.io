      abstract={ In this paper we address the rotation synchronization problem, where the objective is to recover absolute
      rotations starting from pairwise ones, where the unknowns and
      the measures are represented as nodes and edges of a graph,
      respectively. This problem is an essential task for structure from
      motion and simultaneous localization and mapping. We focus on
      the formulation of synchronization via neural networks, which
      has only recently begun to be explored in the literature. Inspired
      by deep matrix completion, we express rotation synchronization
      in terms of matrix factorization with a deep neural network.
      Our formulation exhibits implicit regularization properties and,
      more importantly, is unsupervised, whereas previous deep
      approaches are supervised. Our experiments show that we
      achieve comparable accuracy to the closest competitors in most
      scenes, while working under weaker assumptions.},
