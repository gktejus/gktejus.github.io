I am currently a Systems Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/">Nutanix</a>. In Nutanix, I work closely on live migrations and improving the in-house hypervisor. My research interests vary from Virtualization, Live-Migrations to Computer Vision and Generative Models. I have obtained both my bachelor's and master's from <a href="https://www.iitism.ac.in/">IIT (ISM) Dhanbad</a> in Mathematics and Computing. 

Prior to joining Nutanix, I was an intern at <a href="http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/">MHUG Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.unitn.it/en">University of Trento</a>, where I worked on my thesis under the supervision of <a href="http://elisaricci.eu/">Dr. Elisa Ricci</a> on the topic of Rotation Synchronization. 

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions or collaboration proposals.
